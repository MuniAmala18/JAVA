You are given a Java program called "PalindromeCheckerApp" that checks whether a given number is a palindrome or not. 
A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. 
The program takes an integer input 'n' from the user and calculates its reverse using the "ReverseNum" class. 
Then, it compares the original number 'n' with its reverse to determine if it's a palindrome.
